A Comparison can be made between Web3 ecosystems and large tech companies. Large tech companies are a great case study for Web3 ecosystems due to a number of overlapping areas. Over the last few decades these tech companies have been some of the most desirable places to work on the planet. Partly due to ambitious global missions coupled with great incentives and employee benefits. Although these companies have not got everything right, some great learnings can be made by looking at what has worked well for the employees and for these companies.



**Web3 ecosystem overlapping areas**

Large tech companies can provide a number of useful learnings about growing a large ecosystem that has many full time contributors. Larger companies can share a number of overlapping areas with Web3 ecosystems:

* **Number of contributors involved** - Tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta have scaled to handle a vast number of contributors that work on different products and services within each of their ecosystems.
* **Skill sets** - Both large tech companies and Web3 ecosystems rely heavily on competent software developers to build high quality and scalable solutions that can scale to the masses. Product, design, research and analysis are some other skill sets that both these ecosystems will highly benefit from.
* **Problem scale** - Large tech companies often tackle important global problems. Their products and services can often become important parts of peoples day to day lives.
* **Execution complexity** - Larger tech companies are able to work on highly complex topic areas such as AI, augmented reality and virtual reality. These new technologies can require large investments and longer time horizons to make highly impactful products and services.
* **Shared execution problems** - A number of shared execution problems can exist between teams within these organisations. These problems can lead to collaborative development efforts to create internal tooling and solutions that can benefit the entire organisation. These shared solutions can be adopted by any team working on any product or service. A good example of these types of solutions for shared problems could be React or GraphQL which was developed internally inside Meta and used across the organisation before these solutions were then released publicly as open source software.



**Large company working environment**

Other useful learnings that can be taken from existing tech companies are the environments they have created that can help their contributors focus and thrive whilst they work on important problems. Some of these environmental approaches include:

* **Time based incentives** - Contributors are paid for their time based on an agreed salary. Once this amount is agreed contributors do not need to be concerned with where and how they are getting paid and instead can focus their entire attention on their own work efforts.
* **Bonus incentives** - Large companies often offer performance and impact based incentives in the form of stock option grants, bonuses and job promotions. Work place incentives can also exist which can further help with simplifying and improving the lives of employees.
* **Contribution flexibility** - Employees are able to move across teams and help make impactful contributions where they are most needed. Some companies are more flexible than others in terms of letting people change teams. Employees do not need to be concerned with how they are going to be paid when they work across multiple teams and help with multiple initiatives.
* **Collaborative environment** - Teams working on different projects and services can freely collaborate with any other team in the company. These employees all work in the same company so ultimately they are on the same team! The incentives are fully aligned for employees to collaborate on any problems or opportunities that could be mutually beneficial to address.
* **Quickly changing ideas** - Teams working on different products & services can sometimes autonomously plan their own roadmap and delivery of new features and improvements. This enables them to experiment and trial new ideas quickly as different opportunities emerge without needing approval from the wider company and surrounding teams.
* **Pausing idea execution** - Teams are able to start and stop working on different ideas whenever it makes sense to do so. Some ideas won’t generate the intended outcomes and in that event a team could stop working on it as soon as this becomes more obvious. If a team moves from one idea to another this won’t change or impact their incentives. Each employee and team are ultimately responsible for making as much impact for the company as possible.



**Common reasons people leave large tech companies**

The following are some example common reasons why people leave large companies. This can help with identifying which Web3 funding approaches might help with resolving or reducing these issues in the future.

* **Better work-life balance** - Looking for opportunities that have better work-life balance.
* **Looking for more meaningful work** - Current responsibilities or working environment is uninspiring.
* **Personal values misalignment** - Actions and outcomes generated by the company don’t align with personal values.
* **Lack of career advancement** - A lack of opportunities to grow and learn.
* **Burnout** - A need for recovery due to over working.
* **Management & leadership issues** - Conflict or disagreement with people that have authority.
* **Entrepreneurial aspirations** - Trying to start a new business themselves.
* **Relocation -** Wanting to live and work in another location.
* **Changing work interests** - Looking to try something new or more challenging.



**Large tech companies compared with current Web3 funding landscape**

* **Less complexity to contribute** - A candidate employee would just need to submit their personal and professional information, usually in the form of a CV, to be considered. In Web3 ecosystems contributors need to define and suggest ideas ahead of time which takes a large amount of upfront work.
* **Higher income stability** - Once hired a tech company employee doesn’t need to be concerned about how much income they are receiving each month, it’s pre-determined and agreed. For Web3 contributors they often need to budget ideas ahead of time and this can easily lead to becoming under or over paid due to differences in how long the idea actually takes to execute. They also have reduced stability due to the fact that their ideas they suggest might not be selected to receive funding meaning they may go through periods of receiving no income at all.
* **Higher contribution flexibility** - Employees that join a company are often able to work on numerous ideas and different teams whilst they work in the organisation. The idea that a team is working on could complete change if they had good reason to make this change and address a completely different problem or opportunity. New teams could form to address any emerging problems or opportunities without needing to get company wide approval and that don’t need any new working agreements. In Web3 ecosystems if every idea is funded separately there is a higher complexity to move to different ideas unless there is enough funding available and a working agreement is made about who is going to be paid for what execution efforts. Alternatively if these agreements can’t be made then every single idea would need to be approved and funded separately which delays the speed in which these ideas can be explored and developed. When a token has been created this complexity is only increased further as now the contributors involved in this project are now responsible for maintaining and growing that particular idea and ecosystem that this token is used for. This can easily prevent contributors from being able to move as easily between ideas and help with different initiatives that could have generated a lot of impact for the ecosystem.
* **Easier collaboration** - In companies employees are paid for their contribution efforts each month rather than for the ideas that they suggest and execute. This means it doesn’t matter which idea an employee is working on as long as the outcomes from their efforts help to generate impact for the company. Collectively these employees are all working on the same team which enables teams to more easily identify intersecting problems and opportunities that they could work on collaboratively. Software libraries created in Meta such as React and GraphQL are great examples of this. In Web3 ecosystems collaboration is more complex as funding is allocated through ideas meaning if one team executes these intersecting ideas and doesn’t complete their own funded idea they risk receiving a lower amount of compensation for their efforts due to this idea not being funded and could also risk not being funded in the future due to not focussing on their own idea. Contributors in an idea funding environment have to compete against each other constantly to receive funding which doesn’t fully align the incentives to collaborate and give their time to build out mutually beneficial solutions without the burden of first coming to new working agreements.
* **Less complexity for decision makers** - Companies focus on identifying, attracting and retaining the highest quality people they can to work in their organisation. The complexity for companies is comparing and selecting the best contributors. In Web3 ecosystems this complexity is often far higher as comparing ideas instead of contributors means a lot more information and complexity is introduced. Many of the voters will struggle to have the right level of experience and context about these ideas to make well informed decisions. Web3 ecosystems that want to fully decentralise this idea selection approach will be pushing this massive complexity to the wider community. This idea decision complexity is also a persistent problem for Web3 ecosystems as ideas will constantly change - you don’t keep executing the same idea! In comparison competent contributors do not change as often, and this is why tech companies will look to simply retain their talented employees that work on one or many ideas at a time.



**Web3 funding considerations**

Web3 technology has the potential to completely rewrite how society operates on a day to day basis and influence how incentives flow through these ecosystems to consistently generate impactful outcomes.

When thinking about how to design a funding process for Web3 ecosystems some considerations that can be made are:

* Is this approach more effective than the previous systems and processes we’ve seen before?
* Is it becoming easier or harder for contributors to get involved and receive fair compensation for their efforts?
* Can the funding process feasibly scale to a wider voting audience? Is the complexity increasing or decreasing for voter over time?

There was a time where these tech companies were the most novel, exciting and interesting place to work. It was exciting to watch them rapidly evolve and change to create new markets and address global problems. Blockchain and ledger technology is going through this same phase of excitement and growth, however eventually it will become just another piece of technology like existing internet protocols such as HTTP, SMTP and TCP/IP.&#x20;

Many Web3 ecosystems are trying to recreate and improve the money and systems that society uses on a day to day basis. Creating effective funding processes that help to align and fix the incentives will be a key part of making these emerging Web3 ecosystems thrive over the long term.
