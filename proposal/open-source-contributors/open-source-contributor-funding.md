# Open source contributor funding

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/web3-open-source-contributor-funding.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There is an opportunity for Web3 ecosystems to experiment with an open source contributors funding process. Contributors would be selected and compensated to work on open source initiatives. Founding entities currently often handle the core network & infrastructure development in many Web3 ecosystems. A great starting point for open source contributors could be to become a supporting structure that operates above the founding entities. Contributors would be responsible for helping with the development of protocols and software libraries. This should help with improving the developer experience, the availability of protocols to integrate and smart contract utility libraries as some examples. Ecosystems could also optionally encourage open source contributors to help with network & infrastructure development efforts or application development as well.



**Main suggested experiment approaches**

The following approaches are some of the most important to incorporate into this suggested contributor funding process experiment.

* **Time based incentives** - Contributors would be paid for their time whilst contributing to the ecosystem.
* **Individual monthly contribution logs** - Contributors would submit monthly contribution logs that document the contributions they have made. Contributors would be required to submit these contribution logs to be eligible for payment in the next month.
* **Autonomous decision making** - Contributors should have full autonomy to decide which open source initiatives they are going to work on based on what they believe is the most impactful for the ecosystem. Founding entities and community members can give their feedback and advice about what would be impactful to work on however the actual responsibility of deciding where they spend their time is left to the contributors.



**Ecosystem specific experiment decisions**

The following areas are important parts of making an open source contributor funding process. These areas could be executed in a number of different ways. The ecosystem would need to decide on how they want operate this funding process based on their own preferences and available tools and processes.

* **Contributor information** - Open source contributors would share their personal and professional information along with any of their contribution history information to be considered as a contributor candidate. Ecosystems could collect, store and present this information in whatever approach makes sense in the short term.
* **Voting** - Voters could either be a founding entity or the wider community depending on what voting tools the ecosystem has available.
* **Compensation** - Contributors could request the amount of monthly compensation they are looking for. Voters would decide which candidates they want to accept. Salary range guidelines could also be added to indicate what is acceptable or suitable in terms of the minimum and maximum amount of requested compensation.
* **Contributor working arrangement** - Contributors would be paid for their time spent working in the ecosystem. The working arrangement could be that contributors are paid for a set term length after they are selected. These term lengths could be 3, 6 or 12 months. 6 months could be a suitable starting point.
* **Contributor responsibilities** - Open source contributors would be responsible for supporting the open source initiatives that are most likely to create high impact for the ecosystem. That could range from bug fixes, improvements to existing software or entirely new tools and libraries. Ecosystems may optionally want to provide guidelines on the types of initiatives that could be most impactful based on the current progress and developments of the ecosystem so far.



**Supporting rationale & analysis**

The advantages of this suggested process are covered below. However to read more about the analysis and background behind this proposal it is worth reviewing the disbursement analysis:

## Advantages for c**ontributors**



**Quick & simple participation**

Contributors would submit their personal and professional information along with any contribution history to showcase their skill sets and any impact they have generated for the ecosystem. They then can be considered as a potential candidate to become a paid contributor. Contributors don’t have to suggest new ideas or make financial agreements with existing teams and instead can focus on helping with the executing of any new or existing open source initiative.



**Removed budgeting complexity**

Contributors could work on one or many open source initiatives. The contributor doesn’t need to do budget planning ahead of time for the ideas they work on which saves them time each time they work on a different idea. This removal of budget planning also helps to remove the risks of under or over compensation due to an idea taking longer or shorter than expected. Paying contributors based on the time they work means ideas can more easily change and evolve as required due to a changing environment or requirements. This lack of budgeting requirement is also great for ideas that only take a day or week to complete as now they can just quickly get these done as contributors are paid for their time and don’t need to constantly seek voter approval for every idea they work on.



**Income stability**

Contributors being paid for their time means they will receive increased amount of stability in their income. They will also have full awareness of how long they will be compensated for as their duration of payment will be known ahead of time when they are selected as a contributor. This means contributors can spend their entire time fully focussed on executing impactful ideas rather than being concerned about how much they are being paid and the issues that emerge when an idea takes longer or shorter than expected.



**Flexible contribution**

Contributors could work on one or multiple ideas whilst they are being compensated to work on open source initiatives. This enables a contributor to align their efforts with the initiatives that can generate the most impact for the ecosystem. This autonomy gives the contributor more responsibility and accountability to self identify the most impactful initiatives over time to increase the chances that they get selected again in the future as a contributor. This is most easily achieved due to the fact they won’t be tied to one idea.



**Reduced governance risks**

Funding comes from the treasury and goes directly to the selected contributors. This helps to remove governance risks around having any intermediaries that could have held these assets temporarily. A small number of actors could have misused or stole those funds that were supposed to pay for contribution efforts. Instead by paying contributors directly the incentive risks are localised to each individual contributor and the risk for each contributor is a single months worth of compensation.



**Increased depth of experience**

Contributors that are working on open source initiatives across an ecosystem can help with creating an environment where these contributors could become very well informed about the different approaches that can be used to build applications and protocols. This exposure to many open source initiatives can also help with improving their awareness and understanding of what the biggest problems and opportunities are for improving the developer experience or the network itself that they could then try to resolve with their own contribution efforts or through collaboration with the existing founding entities.



**Reputation building**

Funding that is focused on selecting skilled individuals to help with open source initiatives can help with creating an environment that could benefit from self sovereign identity solutions. Contributors could be able to build up their reputation with different credentials and peer to peer attestations. These credentials could help to provide more evidence about the contributions and impact that each contributor has helped to generate for the ecosystem. Contributors could start building up their reputation at anytime which would then help them with getting selected in future contributor funding decisions.



**Inherits many of the best parts of working for tech companies**

Many of the best parts of working in large tech company environment for employees can be achieved with an open source contributor funding process. The simplicity of time based incentives can help increase contribution flexibility and create more collaborative environments. One advantage of an open source funding process over existing working arrangements in tech companies is that a contributor funding model can push beyond the advantages of working in tech companies by giving contributors even more autonomy over how they decide to generate impact for the ecosystem. The contributor would ultimately be their own boss and have full ownership and responsibility to generate impact and build their own reputation. Contributors would be able to work wherever and whenever they want as long as they generate impact for the ecosystem. Contributor funding could help give people higher levels of flexibility, reputation ownership and autonomy.



**Helps reduce or resolve the common issues of why people leave large tech companies**

* **Better work-life balance & burnout** - Incentives can help to encourage and reward contributors that work harder than others in the ecosystem but the actual choice of how much time a contributor is willing to use from their daily lives is fully up to them.
* **Relocation** - A contributor working for an online Web3 ecosystem can work anywhere in the world they want, relocation should never be an issue!
* **Lack of career advancement & changing work interests** - A contributor would self determine what they work on based on what could generate the most impact for the ecosystem but then also based on their own interests and what areas of work have the most meaning to them. Contributors would have more autonomy to ensure their spending time on areas of interest or professional development that they value.
* **Meaningful work, personal values misalignment & entrepreneurial aspirations** - The outcomes that a contributor generates will be open source and publicly available. Their work could be used by an entire ecosystem and could even make impact more globally. Open source initiatives can help provide ample amounts of opportunity to find meaningful work that align with someones values due to the wide scope and scale of the problems they could work on.
* **Management & leadership issues** - No fixed management or leadership roles need to exist in Web3 ecosystems under a contributor funding approach. No one will be pushing contributors to work over time and beyond their means. If a contributor didn’t enjoy working with another contributor they would be able to move to other initiatives when they believe it made sense to do so.



## Advantages for voters



**Faster and simpler decision making**

Voters wouldn’t need to compare and vote on a number of open source ideas that they might not understand or have enough context for and instead can focus on reviewing the competencies and experience of a number of contributors that could help with the execution of any open source initiative. This selection approach helps to reduce the complexity and time required for voters to participate in the funding process. Decreasing the time required and complexity for voters can help with increasing the amount of voter participation and scalability of the funding process.



**Easier future decisions**

Priorities and ideas will naturally change and evolve over time meaning the complexity of selecting priorities or ideas is a persistent ongoing complexity. However quality contributors are far more consistent over a longer time period which means that contributor selection becomes easier over time as voters become aware of the most competent and effective contributors who they can repeatedly select to receive funding. More tools and processes that help to highlight the performance and impact that someone has generated can further improve this ease of future decision making. Easier funding decisions will help with improving the scalability of the funding process.



**Idea feedback is still captured**

Selecting contributors instead of ideas doesn’t mean the voters wouldn’t have their voices heard when ideas are generated and selected for execution. Any process for generating and selecting ideas can be fully public and invite the entire community to offer their preferences and opinions. The key difference with the open source contributor funding process is it would be the contributors who have the responsibility to select the most promising ideas and respond to any community engagement and feedback. Contributors are paid for their contribution time meaning they can work on any idea during that time period that could be the most impactful for the ecosystem. The contributor is incentivised to respond to community feedback and work on impactful ideas as if they do not they might not get selected in future funding decisions.



## Advantages for Web3 ecosystems



**Efficient usage of incentives**

Assets being disbursed would be actively used to generate impact for the ecosystem as they would only be distributed to contributors to pay for their recent contribution efforts. Contributors would also only be eligible for future payment upon the submission of a monthly contribution log that records their recent contributions. This reduces the amount of assets that are sitting around and not being used immediately to generate contribution efforts that could generate impact for the ecosystem.



**Environment helps create skilled contributors**

Contributors would be able to work across one or many open source initiatives that could generate impact for the ecosystem. This exposure to many problems and applications across the ecosystem can help with providing contributors a lot more context and deeper understanding on whats working and what needs improvement across the ecosystem. Another skill set you help to enable is the ability for contributors to self identify where they can generate the most impact. The contributors who can master this skill of prioritisation the most effectively should have a better chance of being re-selected in future funding decisions and also could be paid increasing amounts of bonus incentives over time as the ecosystem grows to align the incentives with contributors that generate high impact.



**Improved developer experience**

Open source contributors can be a great solution for improving the developer experience over time. Open source initiatives can help with speeding up existing and future teams in developing their own solutions due to new software libraries and relevant source code. Any developer experience improvements could have a large impact on the development of applications across the ecosystem. The faster and cheaper it becomes to build applications the more it can encourage people to build solutions or it could encourage more investment into the ecosystem to experiment with new use cases and opportunities. Open source contributors could directly help support these teams in understanding and applying the different libraries and tools that exist across the ecosystem and help them improve their own solutions. Open source software can create a flywheel of making it easier and easier to develop applications and protocols that are increasingly complex over time.



**Increased collaboration**

Open source contributors can develop new open source software but they can also help existing teams with building their own open source solutions. If a number of contributors are available to help a project there is an increased opportunity for collaboration to emerge across projects when shared problems are identified. Open source contributors will be able to spot problems that are shared across many projects and identify solutions that could be used by many different solutions. These intersecting software solutions could be very useful for many projects to speed up their own development. Contributors could be seen as a collaborative glue that helps to bring together the ecosystem to more easily identify the most impactful shared problems that should be addressed. Increasing the amount of collaboration can help with reducing the amount of duplicated efforts and outcomes that could have been occurred if open source contributors weren’t available to help with developing open source solutions.



**Incentivises open source solutions**

Open source contributors should have a policy that they are only allowed to work on open source software. This simple policy helps to create a positive reinforcing incentive for projects in an ecosystem to open source their code. A project with only a few developers could have immediate access to the support of numerous open source contributors that can help with their projects development if they choose to open source. Projects that decide to not open source their code would need to compete with projects that do which could give them a serious disadvantage. This simple incentive could lead to a growing percentage of projects that open source their code from the start of their project rather than years down the line. The development of the entire ecosystem could be increased due to this compounding effect of having access to lots of open source code as a learning resource for other projects.



**Reduces game theory risks**

Individuals who request funding to become a contributor will do so by stating the expected salary they are looking for. There is a much larger amount of data available online that helps to show what the lower and upper ranges are for different roles and skill sets. This makes it more difficult for a contributor candidate to exaggerate the amount of funding they should expect based on the evidence they provide. This approach can help to prevent the issues that can exist with idea based proposals which can make it easier for proposers to exaggerate the amount of work that needs doing or the different people they need to pay to get the work done.



## Future opportunities & narratives



**Faster adoption of self sovereign identity solutions**

Open source contributors could be a fantastic approach for increasing the speed of adoption of this technology. Credentials could initially just be used to provide proof that a contributor has been selected in the funding process to receive funding and support the ecosystem. They could use just that simple credential for a number of governance related decisions between contributors or for execution decisions. Credentials can then also be useful for recording contribution history, impact and performance, education & skills and any peer to peer attestations. If these types of credentials help to increase the chance that someone becomes a selected contributor in future funding decisions then there is an increasing reason for contributors to adopt and utilise this technology. Funding open source contributors could help create a bottoms up approach to adopting self sovereign identity solutions that could scale to handle a growing amount of contributors over time.



**Impact & performance incentives**

Another exciting area worth ongoing thought is the measuring of impact that each contributor generates and their overall performance. Improving the ecosystems ability to better record and understand which contributors have been the most performant or that have helped to generate the most impact can help with making future funding decisions easier. The top performers could be paid bonus incentives for their contribution efforts which would help to better align the incentives by rewarding the best performers. If performance and impact can be more accurately measured there is an opportunity to explore the usage of algorithmic based solutions that help with suggesting what bonus or salary each contributor could be paid based on their contribution history and the amount of impact they generated.



**Defining the future of work**

Paying people for their time is not a novel concept. However an open source contributors funding process could become an evolution of the existing employment model that is adopted across most companies today. Open source contributors inherit many of the benefits that these previous working arrangements have but then go further than this by giving contributors more flexibility, autonomy and self ownership of their career trajectory and reputation. Contributors would be their own boss and would decide themselves who they work with and what they work on. A good contributor funding process could enable contributors to more freely move around ecosystems based on a provable reputation and be paid what they’re worth based on their contribution history, performance and impact. The tools and processes developed whilst experimenting and building out this funding process could ultimately change how people work in these emerging ecosystems.



**Fixing open source funding**

Trying to fix open source funding has been a growing problem for a number of years. Many open source libraries have become vital solutions and pieces of infrastructure for many large companies and across widely used systems. Getting sufficient funding to pay for the contribution efforts that are needed to develop these software solutions has been an ongoing problem. Web3 ecosystems have an opportunity to fix open source funding. Funding contributors directly to work on open source initiatives is one way this problem could be solved. Contributor compensation could eventually achieve similar or higher levels of compensation than comparative roles in large tech companies as Web3 ecosystems grow and require highly skilled professionals.



**Replacing founding entity structures**

Founding entities are hopefully looking to give up the control and development of the network and give this stewardship and responsibility over to the community. The community would ideally have some way to influence who is paid to help improve and maintain the network. Achieving this will mean making the network more decentralised which would mean fulfilling the original intentions that these networks are governed by the people that use them. The open source contributor funding process could help achieve this outcome as it provides a way for voters to fund contributors that can maintain and improve the network. This process could also help with reducing the potential issues of a single actor or small group of individuals from having excessive amounts of control and influence over the network. Once this funding process matures the employees inside the founding entities could eventually migrate to working for the ecosystem through this same funding process.



## Summary



**Contributor funding could become the most effective and most adopted Web3 funding process**

An open source contributor funding process offers a simple approach for attracting and retaining high quality contributors in a Web3 ecosystem. This approach of paying contributors for their time is not novel and is already proven its effectiveness in existing company structures. Web3 ecosystems have the opportunity to improve upon this model and create highly effective funding processes for supporting and growing their ecosystem.
